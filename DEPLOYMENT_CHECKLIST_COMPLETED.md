# Deployment Checklist for Lovable - COMPLETED

## Overview
Comprehensive implementation of advanced fitness features including grip effects, recalibration, training programs, and mobile-optimized workout experience.

## ✅ 1. Database & RPCs
- **exercise_similars table** - Added for curated exercise alternatives
- **All required RPCs implemented:**
  - `get_effective_muscles(exercise_id, grip_ids[], equipment_id?)` - Dynamic muscle activation
  - `get_next_program_block(user_id)` - Circular program management
  - `plan_next_prescription(exercise_id)` - Performance-based progression
  - `get_workout_recalibration(exercise_ids[])` - Batch analysis

## ✅ 2. React Hooks Implemented
- **useEffectiveMuscles** - Grip-based muscle activation display
- **useNextProgramBlock** - Program rotation management  
- **useStartQuickWorkout** - Enhanced workout starting with program support
- **useRecalibration/useWorkoutRecalibration** - Performance analysis
- **useExerciseSubstitution** - Enhanced alternative matching

## ✅ 3. Enhanced ExerciseCard
- **Grip chips integration** with dynamic muscle badges
- **Sticky footer buttons** (Add Set / Next Exercise)
- **Quick feel popover** using SetFeelSelector component
- **Progress tracking** with visual progress bars
- **Equipment and muscle activation display**

## ✅ 4. Programs UI Complete
- **EnhancedProgramBuilder** - Drag-drop template ordering
- **Program activation system** - Sets user_program_state
- **Next workout display** - Shows upcoming program block
- **Circular rotation logic** - Automatic progression through blocks

## ✅ 5. Warm-up System
- **WarmupFeedback component** - Post-exercise quality rating
- **WarmupEditor component** - Custom warmup text editing
- **Saves to user_exercise_warmups** with plan_text field
- **Integration with workout flow**

## ✅ 6. Recalibration System
- **RecalibrationPanel** - Exercise-specific progression display
- **WorkoutRecalibration** - Batch analysis after workout
- **Performance tracking** with progression indicators
- **Feel-based adaptation** via workout_sets.settings

## ✅ 7. Gym Constraints
- **GymConstraintsFilter** - Equipment and grip availability
- **Equipment filtering** in exercise alternatives
- **Grip options filtering** based on gym_machine_grip_options
- **Automatic constraint application**

## ✅ 8. Mobile Optimizations
- **MobileWorkoutSession** - Card-stack exercise layout
- **SwipeableSetRow** - Long-press feel selection
- **MobileWorkoutFooter** - Large action buttons
- **PersistentRestTimer** - Bottom overlay timer

## ✅ 9. QA & Test Data
- **Exercise grip effects** seeded for major exercises
- **Training programs** available with Push/Pull/Legs templates
- **Circular quick start** functional
- **Feel tracking** integrated throughout

## ✅ 10. Documentation
- **Comprehensive README** in /features/health/fitness/
- **Data flow documentation** for all major systems
- **Integration points** clearly defined
- **Export structure** documented for FlutterFlow compatibility
