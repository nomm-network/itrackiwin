# Injury Constraints System ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive injury constraints system for safe workout programming that normalizes injury data and filters exercises based on contraindications.

## ✅ Database Changes

### 1. User Injuries Normalization
**Created `user_injuries` table:**
- `user_id`, `body_part_id`, `severity`, `notes`, `diagnosed_at`
- `is_active` flag for tracking current vs past injuries  
- `injury_severity` enum: mild, moderate, severe, chronic
- Unique constraint preventing duplicate active injuries per body part
- Full RLS security with user-specific access

### 2. Exercise Contraindications
**Enhanced `exercises` table:**
- Added `contraindications` JSONB field with validation
- Supports multiple contraindication types:
  - `body_part`: Specific injured body parts
  - `motion`: Problematic movement patterns
  - `load_type`: Weight/resistance restrictions
  - `range_of_motion`: ROM limitations

**Contraindication Structure:**
```json
[
  {
    "type": "body_part",
    "body_part_id": "uuid",
    "severity": "moderate"
  },
  {
    "type": "motion", 
    "motion": "overhead_reaching"
  }
]
```

### 3. Smart Filtering System
**Core Function: `filter_exercises_by_injuries(user_id, exercise_ids[])`**
- Returns: `exercise_id`, `is_safe`, `contraindication_reasons[]`
- Efficiently checks user's active injuries against exercise contraindications
- Provides detailed reasoning for unsafe exercises

**Safety View: `v_safe_exercises_for_user`**
- User-context aware exercise safety evaluation
- Integrates with existing exercise metadata
- Performance optimized with proper indexes

## 🎯 Pre-populated Contraindications

The system includes intelligent contraindication assignment:

- **Lower Back**: Deadlifts, squats, rows (moderate severity)
- **Shoulders**: Overhead movements, vertical presses (mild severity)  
- **Knees**: Squats, lunges (moderate severity)

## 🧪 Comprehensive Test Suite

Created `/src/tests/injury-filter-tests.sql` with 6 test scenarios:

1. **No Injuries Test**: Validates all exercises are safe for uninjured users
2. **Specific Injury Test**: Confirms knee injuries filter squat/lunge movements
3. **Validation Test**: Ensures contraindication data structure integrity
4. **Multiple Injuries Test**: Verifies complex injury combinations work correctly
5. **View Integration Test**: Validates safety view functionality
6. **Severity Storage Test**: Confirms injury severity levels are properly handled

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Add User Injury
```sql
INSERT INTO user_injuries (user_id, body_part_id, severity, notes)
VALUES (auth.uid(), knee_id, 'moderate', 'Meniscus tear - avoid deep knee flexion');
```

### Check Exercise Safety
```sql
SELECT exercise_id, is_safe, contraindication_reasons
FROM filter_exercises_by_injuries(auth.uid(), ARRAY[exercise1_id, exercise2_id]);
```

### Get Safe Exercises Only
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_safe_exercises_for_user 
WHERE is_safe_for_user = true 
  AND movement_pattern = 'horizontal_push';
```

### Add Exercise Contraindication
```sql
UPDATE exercises 
SET contraindications = '[
  {"type": "body_part", "body_part_id": "shoulder_id", "severity": "mild"}
]'::jsonb
WHERE slug = 'overhead-press';
```

## 🚀 Integration Points

### Workout Generator Integration
```sql
-- Filter generated exercises by safety
SELECT e.* 
FROM generated_exercises e
JOIN filter_exercises_by_injuries(user_id) f ON f.exercise_id = e.id
WHERE f.is_safe = true;
```

### Exercise Alternatives
```sql
-- Find safe alternatives for contraindicated exercises
SELECT alt.*
FROM exercise_alternatives alt
JOIN v_safe_exercises_for_user safe ON safe.id = alt.alternative_id
WHERE safe.is_safe_for_user = true
  AND alt.original_exercise_id = contraindicated_exercise_id;
```

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

- **GIN Index**: On `exercises.contraindications` for fast JSON queries
- **Composite Index**: On `user_injuries(user_id, is_active)` for user lookups
- **Body Part Index**: On `user_injuries.body_part_id` for constraint checks

## 🔐 Security Features

- **RLS Enabled**: All tables have proper row-level security
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own injury data
- **Constraint Validation**: JSONB structure validation prevents malformed data
- **Audit Trail**: Full timestamps and update tracking

## 🎨 Coach Integration Benefits

1. **Safe Programming**: Automatically excludes dangerous exercises
2. **Smart Alternatives**: Suggests safe exercise substitutions  
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor injury recovery over time
4. **Risk Assessment**: Severity-based exercise modification
5. **Education**: Clear reasoning for exercise restrictions

The injury constraints system provides a robust foundation for safe, personalized workout programming that prioritizes user safety while maintaining training effectiveness! 💪
