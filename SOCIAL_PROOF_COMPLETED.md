- **Multiple PR types**: Weight PRs, Rep PRs, Estimated 1RM PRs
- **Real-time comparison** against existing personal records
- **Database integration** with `personal_records` table

### 2. PR Toast Notifications (`src/components/gamification/PRToast.tsx`)
- **Celebratory toasts** for new PRs with trophy icons
- **Exercise-specific messaging** with formatted values
- **Share button integration** for instant social sharing
- **8-second display duration** for proper celebration

### 3. Social Sharing System (`src/hooks/useSocialShare.ts`)

- `workout_comments` - Comment system for shared workouts

### Triggers

3. New PRs trigger celebratory toasts with share options
4. XP rewards are automatically awarded
5. Database triggers handle the actual PR storage

### Social Integration
1. PR toast includes optional share button
2. One-tap sharing creates workout share with PR caption
3. Community can like and comment on PR announcements
4. Social feed displays PR achievements prominently

## User Experience Enhancements
