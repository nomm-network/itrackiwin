-- DELETE FROM public.workout_sets;
-- DELETE FROM public.workout_exercises;

-- 3) Clear any template layers that reference exercises (so FKs don't block).
DELETE FROM public.template_exercises;
DELETE FROM public.workout_templates

  SELECT DISTINCT template_id FROM public.program_blocks_exercises
) OR TRUE; -- remove this WHERE if nothing depends on templates

-- 4) Clear exercise relationship tables (order matters less if FKs have ON DELETE CASCADE,
--    but we do it explicitly to be safe across environments).
DELETE FROM public.exercise_handle_grips;
DELETE FROM public.exercise_grips;
DELETE FROM public.exercise_handles;
DELETE FROM public.exercise_muscles;
DELETE FROM public.exercises_translations;

-- 5) Finally clear the exercises table.
DELETE FROM public.exercises;

-- 6) Keep equipment / handles / grips and their translations as-is.
--    If you said to keep them, we're done.
