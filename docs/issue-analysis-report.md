## Issue #1: Weight and Height Fields Missing from Fitness Profile

### Problem Description
The fitness profile configuration page shows a "Body Metrics Tracking" section with text stating that "Weight and height tracking has been moved to the dedicated Body Metrics section for better historical tracking" instead of showing actual input fields for weight and height.

### Technical Analysis

#### Database Structure ✅ CORRECT
```sql
Table: user_body_metrics
- user_id (uuid) - Links to authenticated user
- weight_kg (numeric) - Body weight in kilograms  
- height_cm (numeric) - Height in centimeters
- source (text) - Data entry method
- recorded_at (timestamp) - Measurement date
- created_at (timestamp) - Record creation
```

#### Code Structure ❌ BROKEN
The `FitnessProfile.tsx` component contains:
1. Proper form setup with weight/height fields 
2. Database integration with `user_body_metrics` table
3. BUT also includes redirect logic sending users away from inline editing

#### Root Cause
The component logic prioritizes directing users to a separate body metrics section instead of allowing direct weight/height input within the fitness profile form.

#### Expected Behavior
- User should see weight input field in fitness profile
- User should see height input field in fitness profile  
- Data should save to `user_body_metrics` table with historical tracking
- Form should show current values from latest metrics record

#### Current Broken Behavior
- Shows informational message about moved functionality
- No input fields visible
- User cannot enter or update weight/height
- Form completion blocked

## Issue #2: Incorrect Exercise Form Display for Bodyweight Exercises

### Problem Description  
The dips exercise (and other bodyweight exercises) displays the weight/reps form instead of the specialized bodyweight exercise form, despite being properly configured as a bodyweight exercise in the database.

### Technical Analysis

#### Database Configuration ✅ CORRECT
```sql
Exercise: Dips
- ID: 6da86374-b133-4bf1-a159-fd9bbb715316
- load_mode: "bodyweight_plus_optional" ✅
- effort_mode: "reps" ✅
- equipment_id: fb81ae58-bf4e-44e8-b45a-6026147bca8e

Equipment: Dip Bars
- ID: fb81ae58-bf4e-44e8-b45a-6026147bca8e
- slug: "dip-bars" ✅
- equipment_type: "bodyweight" ✅
- load_type: "none" ✅
```

#### Form Selection Logic ❌ BROKEN
The `SmartSetForm.tsx` component should detect bodyweight exercises through:

1. **Primary Detection**: `load_mode` check
   - Should detect: "bodyweight_plus_optional" 
   - Should detect: "external_assist"

2. **Secondary Detection**: Equipment-based
   - Should detect: equipment.slug === "dip-bars"
   - Should detect: equipment.equipment_type === "bodyweight"

#### Expected Form Features for Bodyweight Exercises
```
BodyweightSetForm should display:
✓ Reps input field
✓ Optional additional weight input  
✓ Quick weight buttons (0kg, 5kg, 10kg, 15kg, 20kg, 25kg)
✓ Bodyweight indicator section
✓ Current bodyweight display
✓ Total load calculation (bodyweight + additional weight)
✓ Assistance options for assisted exercises
```

#### Current Broken Behavior
```
WeightRepsSetForm incorrectly shows:
❌ Weight (kg) input field
❌ Reps input field
❌ No bodyweight awareness
❌ No quick weight buttons
❌ No bodyweight status display
❌ Treats as regular weight training exercise
```

### Detection Flow Analysis

The form selection should follow this logic:
```
1. Check effort_mode for cardio → CardioSetForm
2. Check load_mode for bodyweight → BodyweightSetForm  
3. Check equipment for bodyweight → BodyweightSetForm
4. Default fallback → WeightRepsSetForm
```

**Problem**: The detection logic is failing at steps 2 and 3, causing bodyweight exercises to fall through to the default WeightRepsSetForm.

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience Impact
- **High**: Users cannot configure basic body metrics in fitness profile
- **High**: Bodyweight exercises provide incorrect interface, leading to data quality issues
- **Medium**: Workout logging accuracy compromised for bodyweight movements
- **Medium**: User confusion about different exercise types

### Data Quality Impact  
- **High**: Body metrics data missing affects workout calculations
- **High**: Incorrect form usage leads to improperly logged sets
- **Medium**: Progression tracking compromised for bodyweight exercises

### System Functionality Impact
- **High**: Core fitness profile setup broken
- **High**: Exercise form selection system unreliable
- **Medium**: User onboarding flow interrupted

## Recommended Fix Priority

### Priority 1: Fix Weight/Height Input (CRITICAL)
- Restore direct weight/height input fields in fitness profile
- Ensure data saves to user_body_metrics table
- Remove redirect logic that blocks inline editing

### Priority 2: Fix Exercise Form Detection (CRITICAL)  
- Debug SmartSetForm detection logic order
- Verify load_mode matching conditions
- Verify equipment-based detection conditions
- Add comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Priority 3: Validation Testing (HIGH)
- Test all bodyweight exercises (dips, pull-ups, push-ups, etc.)
- Test assisted exercises (assisted pull-ups, etc.)
- Verify form data saves correctly
- Test progression and historical tracking
