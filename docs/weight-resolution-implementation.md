# Weight Resolution System Implementation Summary

This document tracks the implementation status of the comprehensive weight resolution system for gym equipment.

## Overview

The weight resolution system is designed to provide accurate, gym-specific weight recommendations for exercises, supporting mixed units (kg/lb), equipment constraints, and progressive loading patterns.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Step 7: Mixed-Unit & Inventory Consistency (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Support gyms with both kg and lb equipment, ensuring accurate conversions and increments.

**Database Changes**:
- Added `native_unit` columns to `user_gym_plates`, `user_gym_dumbbells`, `user_gym_miniweights`
- Added `label` and `color` columns for equipment differentiation
- Created unique constraints for mixed-unit inventories
- Added `sum_plates_mixed_units()` and `calculate_mixed_unit_increment()` functions

**Code Implementation**:
- `src/lib/equipment/mixedUnits.ts` - Core conversion utilities
- `src/hooks/useMixedUnitGymInventory.ts` - Inventory management hooks
- `src/features/equipment/components/MixedUnitInventoryDisplay.tsx` - Admin UI
- `src/features/workouts/components/MixedUnitWeightDisplay.tsx` - Workout UI

**Key Features**:
- Single source of truth for weight conversions
- Native + Converted display columns in admin screens
- Subtle conversion hints in workout screens (e.g., "25 kg â‰ˆ 55.1 lb")
- Mixed inventory increment calculations
- No duplicate storage of converted values

**Validation**:
- Round-trip conversion accuracy within 0.1 lb tolerance
- Mixed set tests with kg plates + lb micro plates
- UI display tests across unit preference changes

### âœ… Step 10: Safe Rollout System (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Zero-downtime migration system with feature flags and monitoring.

**Database Changes**:
- Created `app_flags` table for feature flag management
- Added `is_feature_enabled()` helper function
- Created `weight_resolution_log` table for telemetry
- Added `unit` and `resolution_source` columns to `workouts` table
- Created compatibility views for gradual migration

**Code Implementation**:
- `src/lib/equipment/featureFlags.ts` - Feature flag utilities
- Updated `src/lib/equipment/resolveLoad.ts` with v2 logic and logging
- `src/features/workouts/components/FeatureFlagIndicator.tsx` - Client monitoring

**Key Features**:
- Feature flag controlled rollout
- Automatic fallback to v1 on errors
- Comprehensive telemetry logging
- Client-side flag status monitoring
- A/B testing capability

**Monitoring**:
- Resolution accuracy tracking
- Performance metrics
- Error rate monitoring
- Feature adoption analytics

## Pending Steps

### ðŸ”„ Step 8: Load Pattern Templates (NEXT)
- Standardized loading patterns (linear, wave, block periodization)
- Pattern-aware weight suggestions
- Auto-adjustment based on performance data

### ðŸ”„ Step 9: Integration & Validation
- End-to-end testing across all components
- Performance optimization
- User acceptance testing

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Weight Conversion Layer** (`mixedUnits.ts`)
   - Canonical kg storage with display-time conversion
   - Precision handling for different units
   - Validation utilities

2. **Equipment Resolution** (`resolveLoad.ts`)
   - Gym-specific inventory awareness
   - Load type handling (barbell, dumbbell, stack)
   - Feature flag integration

3. **Database Functions**
   - `sum_plates_mixed_units()` - Cross-unit plate calculations
   - `calculate_mixed_unit_increment()` - Minimum increment logic
   - `is_feature_enabled()` - Feature flag checking

4. **UI Components**
   - Admin inventory management with native/converted views
   - Workout displays with conversion hints
   - Feature flag status indicators

### Data Flow

```
User Input (any unit) â†’ toKg() â†’ Database (kg storage) â†’ getDisplayUnit() â†’ UI (user preference)
                                        â†“
                              Equipment Resolution (gym inventory) â†’ Load Suggestion
```

## Configuration

### Feature Flags
- `gym_equipment_v2` - Controls new resolution system
- Additional flags can be added via `app_flags` table

### Environment Variables
- No environment variables required
- All configuration stored in database

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**: All schema changes are idempotent and safe
2. **Feature Rollout**: Use `app_flags` to control percentage rollout
3. **Monitoring**: Check `weight_resolution_log` for system health
4. **Rollback**: Disable feature flag to revert to v1 system
