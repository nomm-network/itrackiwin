## 🎯 **SMART DEFAULTS IMPLEMENTED (100%)**

### Exercise Default Grips (20 Core Lifts)
| Exercise Family | Default Strategy | Examples |
|----------------|------------------|----------|
| **Bench Press** | Overhand grip | Flat, incline, decline bench press |
| **Pull-ups** | Overhand primary, underhand secondary | Pull-ups, chin-ups, lat pulldowns |

### Biomechanically Sound Selections
- **Pressing movements** → overhand for optimal wrist alignment
- **Pulling movements** → overhand for maximum lat activation
- **Bicep isolation** → underhand for supination requirement
- **Heavy pulls** → mixed grip secondary for grip security
