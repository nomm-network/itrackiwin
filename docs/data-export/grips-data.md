# Grips Data Export

## Grip Items (4 total - Simplified System)

### Orientation-Based Grips
All grips are categorized as `hand_position` with full English/Romanian translations:

1. **overhand** (Priză pronată)
   - Standard overhand/pronated grip
   - Most common grip for pulling movements
   - Default grip for most exercises

2. **underhand** (Priză supinată) 
   - Underhand/supinated grip
   - Common for bicep movements and chin-ups
   - Alternative grip option

3. **neutral** (Priză neutră/ciocan)
   - Neutral/hammer grip position
   - Palms facing each other
   - Joint-friendly grip option

4. **mixed** (Priză mixtă/alternată)
   - Alternating grip (one over, one under)
   - Used primarily for deadlifts
   - Specialized grip for heavy lifting

## Design Philosophy

### Simplified from Complex System
- Previously had multiple grip categories (width, spacing, etc.)
- Now focused only on hand orientation for clarity
- Reduced complexity while maintaining functionality

### Usage Patterns
- **overhand**: Default for most exercises (set as default in seeding)
- **underhand**: Bicep curls, chin-ups, reverse movements
- **neutral**: Hammer curls, neutral-grip pulldowns, joint-friendly option
- **mixed**: Heavy deadlifts, grip strength variations

### Compatibility
- All handles are compatible with all 4 grips
- Equipment-handle-grip mappings default to "overhand"
- Users can select alternative grips as needed
- System falls back to all grips if compatibility tables are empty
