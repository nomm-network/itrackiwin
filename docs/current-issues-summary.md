# Current Issues Summary & Solutions

## ‚úÖ RESOLVED: TypeScript Build Errors
All TypeScript errors related to property access have been fixed. The code now properly handles translation data structure.

## üîç MAIN ISSUE: Exercise Data Population

### Current State:
- **Database Tables**: Well-populated with movements, equipment, muscles, etc.
- **Exercises Table**: Only 2 exercises (should have 42 from insertion script)
- **Problem**: Slug mismatches in exercise seeding script

### Root Cause:
The exercise insertion script in `scripts/exercise-seed-batch2.sql` looks for muscle slugs with **hyphens** but our database has **underscores**:

**Script expects:**
- `erector-spinae`
- `front-delts` 
- `triceps-lateral-head`

**Database has:**
- `erector_spinae`
- `front_delts`
- `triceps_lateral_head`

### Solution:
Update the `WHERE` clauses in the exercise seeding script to use underscores instead of hyphens:

```sql
-- Change lines like this:
WHERE slug = 'erector-spinae'
-- To this:
WHERE slug = 'erector_spinae'
```

### Verification Commands:
Run these queries to verify muscle slugs:
```sql
-- Check what muscle slugs exist
SELECT slug FROM muscles WHERE slug LIKE '%erector%' OR slug LIKE '%delt%' OR slug LIKE '%tricep%';

-- Check equipment slugs
SELECT slug FROM equipment WHERE slug IN ('barbell', 'dumbbell', 'cable-machine');
```

### Next Steps:
1. **Fix the muscle slug mismatches** in the exercise seeding script
2. **Re-run the exercise insertion** to get all 42 exercises
3. **Populate handle/grip relationships** for exercises
4. **Test the UI** to ensure exercises display correctly

## üìÅ Documentation Created:
- `docs/database-schema.md` - Complete schema documentation
- `docs/foreign-keys.md` - All relationship mappings  
- `docs/database-exports.md` - Current data state

All build errors are now resolved and the codebase is ready for exercise data population!
